The development of the Zozzariello idea is going on and Antonino has published recently a ZozOT for [Emoncms](http://emoncms.org/) (by [Open Energy Monitor](http://souliss.github.io/2013/10/mix-open-energy-monitor-and-souliss.html)), ZozOT is an Android application that collects data from SoulissApp through Zozzariello (an HTTP/JSON server embed in SoulissApp) and then post those into the cloud.

Zozzariello turns an Android device (like an old smartphone or tablet) into an home server, that control your Souliss devices and post them to the cloud.

Soon the Android ZozOT Apps will be available for download from the Drive repository.
