Souliss widgets are available with latest app version. You can choose the device to send the command to and operate your home directly from your Android homescreen.

To operate correctly the app needs to be installed on phone's memory, otherwise the widget won't be listed. The feature is still in development, so please report any stacktrace you'll be willing to.

A life checker mechanism has been implemented to revive Souliss background service in case it's enabled and dies. Better connection checking allows the app to operate across network connectivity changes.
