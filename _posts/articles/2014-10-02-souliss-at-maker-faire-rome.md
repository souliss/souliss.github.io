A month ago [Michele has started a discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/souliss/17LrGVDQICM) on the mailing list to get Souliss running on their Titino demo system, thanks to Fulvio and Juan after some tries Michele got a fully working automation demo over nine nodes connected via RS485.

[Titino](http://www.titino.eu/?lang=en) is an RS485 transceiver that allow remote programming of Arduino nodes and using Souliss build an automation network over that bus.

Here some pictures from the faire,
