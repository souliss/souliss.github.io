[Chit-Chat](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/22/creepy-iot-3-ways-to-automate-halloween/) about #IoT is becoming noisy, automation being part of it. So we couldn't delay SoulissApp APIs any longer, even doubting anyone will ever use them. [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) and [Automate](http://llamalab.com/automate/) are two popular tools to automate thing, they already implement any sort of complex and integrated behaviour so that we only had to figure out how to integrate them. Now you can open window blinds shaking your phone. Neat? Please let us know about creative and weird Tasker profiles you may be using with Souliss.

From next release of SoulissApp, send and receive from SoulissApp through general Intent or Tasker (and Automate) Plugin will be supported, we have a growing [wiki page](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/SoulissApp-API) dedicated to SoulissApp integrations.
