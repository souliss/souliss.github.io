Cheap and bright LED strips gives a lot of fun and way to experiments new lighting scenarios, we started some months ago including control via Android and adding the music driven effect, releasing an [Arduino based networked solution to light multiple LED strips at same time](http://souliss.github.io/2013/08/arduino-and-android-lets-start-home.html), using shields like the Open Electronics one.

Today [Kasper](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/souliss/B-4U9uJyx5k) moved our examples one step over, mixing the music driven effect of Souliss and Android with a [shift register board](http://www.elcojacobs.com/shiftpwm/) to power multiple strips or LEDs, he shared a short video called Arduino RGB LED strip control with Souliss and ShiftPWM on YouTube.

Is awesome see people moving further and improving the Souliss experience.
