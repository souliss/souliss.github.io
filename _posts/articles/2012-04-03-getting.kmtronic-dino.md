Since the beginning of the project, we intended to develop an electronic board dedicated to the project, a simple to use and cheap board used within the Souliss framework let easy make automation in the home. The prototyping boards supported are nice and work well, but require additional hardware for interaction with the electric appliances in the home.

So we started supporting ready to use I/O boards, where no additional hardware is required, that will make easy and automated installation. Today I've received two DINo boards from [KMTronic](http://www.kmtronic.com/) that is supporting Souliss with its hardware.

The DINo has four insulated inputs with 5-24V range and same number of relays output, rated at 10A/220 V,  the uC is an SMD ATmega328P with the Arduino bootloader and the Microchip EN28J60 as Ethernet controller.

Souliss was supporting only the Wiznet W5100 as Ethernet controller, so now is starting the development of the new drivers for vNet (one of Souliss framework layer). Both W5100 and ENC28J60 will be supported and integrated in the framework.

Hope it will work,
Dario.
