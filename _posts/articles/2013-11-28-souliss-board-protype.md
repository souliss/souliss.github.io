Slowly we are moving forward, Marco just got the PCB for the [boards](http://souliss.github.io/2013/09/3d-rendering-for-new-rs-485-boards.html) and we hope that first prototypes will be out soon.

On the left-top side there are the PCB for the relay boards, on the right-bottom the LED ones. This is a complete set of PCB, including the gateway board and the push button one.

As first step, Marco will build the prototypes and have a try to find out if they power-up properly and all the I/O and communication peripheral works properly. After it will be the time to have some experiments with the new [collision avoidance USART driver](http://souliss.github.io/2013/09/usart-driver-for-vnet.html), that is in Souliss since A4.4, but hasn't been used right now.

It will probably be a long way, but is exciting see pieces that just some weeks ago was just a drawing on a PC.

There will be more post in between, showing the building phase and the first results.

Stay tuned!
