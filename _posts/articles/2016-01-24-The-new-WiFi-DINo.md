This is the time where more and more **ESP8266 based** devices are popping-up and [KMP Electronics](http://www.kmpelectronics.eu/) is coming also with a new design, a ProDINo based on the popular WiFi SOC. In these years we had a very close partnership with KMP Electronics and the design of the new board has started based on a common brainstorming on specification required by the new module.

> The board carriers four relays and four opto-input as the previous DINo and keep the RS485 transceiver to create mixed WiFi/Ethernet network, as well as UEXT and Grove connector for easy expansion.

This is an earlier design started around our experience with ESP8266 and RS485, the new WiFi ProDINo (the final name hasn't yet been defined) will keep compatibility with the [actual ProDINo based on Wiznet W5200](http://www.kmpelectronics.eu/en-us/products/prodinoethernet.aspx), so that you can build a Souliss based network with a mix of Ethernet, WiFi and RS485.

| Specification | Type and Nominal Value |
|:---:|:---:|
| Power Supply | DC/DC Switching from 9 to 30 VDC |
| SoC | ESP8266 - ESP-12 |
| MCU | 32-bit RISC CPU based on Tensilica Xtensa LX106 running at 80 MHz |
| Communication | WiFi - IEEE 802.11 b/g/n |
| Communication | Half Duplex RS485 - TIA-485-A |
| I/O Expansion | I2C MCP23S08 |
| Input | No. 4 Opto-isolated |
| Output | No. 4 Monostable Relay 15 A / 10 A |
| Programming | Via onboard USB connection |
| Expansion | Grove and UEXT |
| Terminal | Pluggable |

Overall the new board will be smaller than the actual ProDINo and will get more flexibility from the **pluggable terminals** and the expansion connector based on **Grove and UEXT**, price and release date are not yet available, but on these pages will get all the updates.

Stay tuned!
