Isn't a surprice, Google wasn't longer working on Code, their hosting project that for several years has offered an home for many open-source projects, a lot of code has been moved in other hosting services and even the latest Google project were no longer hosted in Code.

We will miss Code, mainly for the simple and intuitive web interface, but is now time to move on GitHub! Starting from today Souliss project code has been migrated and is now time to start using the amazing features that GitHub offers and were not available in Code.

Join us on [http://souliss.github.io](http://souliss.github.io/), register on GitHub and fork the code to get your own repository!
