Souliss client is currently at version 0.7.9 This version isn't public yet, because thorough testing is still needed, but I can anticipate some of the main new features:

* More stable status updates
* New supported typicals (gates and motorized appliances) 
* Hour, month and history Graphs (currently humidity and temperature) 
* Sensor typicals logging 
* New app light theme 
* Geocoding of user's position

The app fully supports Android 4 ICS, all of the network calls have been moved to separate threads; the app should be responsive with both wireless or 3G connectivity. There is still much work to do, the client has to be aligned with Souliss new features and hardware, so stay tuned for updates!
