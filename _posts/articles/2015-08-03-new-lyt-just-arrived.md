Just received from our friends at [Authometion](http://authometion.com/) a sample kit with three LYT88 RGBW and a shield based on ESP8266. I've played in the past with the previous prototypes of LYT that has been in my home for almost a year with very good result.

> The [LYT bulb sells at 24,90 euros](http://authometion.com/shop/it/home/2-lampadina-lyt-9w-rgbw-e27.html) and are as far as I know are the only Arduino controllable LED bulb on the market.

Those will be officially included in the next Souliss release, so lets start to get your lamps on the [Authometion store!](http://authometion.com/shop/it/)
