Are almost three years that Maker Faire is in Rome for the European edition, this year we have powered the Authometion and IONO booths with Souliss and had the change to meet them and have some fun looking over the many expositor of the faire.

At the Authometion booth there were a couple of LYT8266 running Souliss and our logo on their flayers, has been nice and hopefully next year we will be there again.

It was of course an opportunity for an informal meeting with pizzas, friarielli and other street food dishes
