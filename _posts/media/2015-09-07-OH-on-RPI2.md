This tutorial has been written in occasion of my OH installation on a brand new RPi2 model B.
It is meant to be a step by step guide to help myself (and others) in case of new installations.

# Purchasing the hardware

I had a RPi1 model B already running in my apartment with OpenHAB and other backup services.
It was running not very fine, mainly suffering from the slow CPU trying to run the JVM.
On that machine OpenHAB was often slow giving a bad user experience.

OpenHAB community have a hardware FAQ page [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Hardware-FAQ) suggesting BananaPi over RPi due to its SATA connection much more efficient than the microSD.
Personally I decided for the RPi because of its vast community and because I did not like the idea to have an additional SATA HDD outside the tiny box.

I decided to get a RPi2b + NOOBS + black case available for â‚¬46,50 from [RS](http://it.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8772457/?origin=PSF_431027|fp&cm_sp=featureproducts-_-FeaturedProductsContent-_-8772457)

# Configuring the RPi (headless)

## Connecting

Just plug the Ethernet connector to your network and power up the unit providing 5Vdc via the micro USB connector.
The unit is shipped with dynamic IP address and if you have a DHCP server in your LAN it will get a proper IP.
Open your router webpage and look for the assigned IP address, otherwise use [Fing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing&hl=en) application for Android to get the address; you should look for Raspberry Pi Foundation device.

In my case I got 192.168.1.204

By using ssh (on Linux) or Putty (on Windows) you can connect to that IP.
The default root user is 'pi' and the default password is 'raspberry'
You may eventually change the password with `sudo raspi-config` command

## Setting a static IP Address
I followed a really nice guide available [here](http://www.modmypi.com/blog/tutorial-how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address)

And basically I edited the network configuration file with command *sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces*
![dhcp](http://souliss.github.io/images/2015-09/commandline.png)

Simply change the line that reads:

`iface eth0 inet *dhcp*`

to

`iface eth0 inet *static*`

Then directly below this line enter the following (Please Note. You will need your own addresses we gathered in Part B, more details below). . . .

{% highlight c %}
address 192.168.1.3
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.1.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
gateway 192.168.1.1
{% endhighlight %}

![2015-09-08 00_46_21-pi raspberrypi_](http://souliss.github.io/images/2015-09/commandline2.png)

`sudo rm /var/lib/dhcp/*`

Then we'll need to reboot and check your changes. . .

`sudo reboot`

Log back in and run

`ifconfig`

Which should reveal your new settings.

# Installing JVM

NOOBS comes with pre-installed java.
You can easily check this by calling the command:

`java -version`

{% highlight c %}
pi@rpi2-openhab ~ $ java -version
java version "1.8.0"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-b132)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.0-b70, mixed mode)
{% endhighlight %}

# Installing OpenHAB

Derived from [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/OpenHAB-on-Raspberry-Pi/?ALLSTEPS) step by step guide.

Create the OH folder

`sudo mkdir /opt/openhab`

Move to that folder

`cd /opt/openhab`

Visit the OpenHAB [download page](http://www.openhab.org/getting-started/downloads.html) and copy the runtime package web address to be used in the command below.

download the package typing:

`sudo wget https://bintray.com/artifact/download/openhab/bin/distribution-1.7.1-runtime.zip`

unzip the package

`sudo unzip distribution-1.7.1-runtime.zip`

remove the package

`sudo rm distribution-1.7.1-runtime.zip`


Move to the addons directory

`cd addons`

download the addons package

`sudo wget https://bintray.com/artifact/download/openhab/bin/distribution-1.7.1-addons.zip`

unzip the package

`sudo unzip distribution-1.7.1-addons.zip`

Remove the package

`sudo rm distribution-1.7.1-addons.zip`


Visit [this page](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzyjHRwlzov4WlgtSG0tejJ3aE0&usp=sharing#list) to get the latest version of Souliss OpenHAB binding

Copy file org.openhab.binding.souliss_1.7.0.201507152300.jar in folder /opt/openhab/addons

## Configure Souliss binding

The following steps are basically following the [souliss-openhab wiki](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/openHAB-Binding).

### Souliss binding basic configuration

Move to configuration folder:

`cd /opt/openhab/configurations`

Create a copy of the default cfg files to add your personal settings:

`cp openhab_default.cfg openhab.cfg`

Edit the file :

`sudo nano openhab.cfg`

Add the following lines a the bottom:

{% highlight c %}
################################ Souliss Binding ##########################################

###########################################################################################
{% endhighlight %}
My complete openhab.cfg file is published [here](https://github.com/ribico/gr-home-automation/blob/master/openhab/configurations/openhab.cfg)

### items configuration

Move to items folder:

`cd /opt/openhab/configurations/items`

Create an item file:

`sudo nano souliss.items`

Add your souliss items using the syntax `{souliss=<Typical>:<nodeID>:<slot>:[<bit>]}` as detailed described in the howto guide [here](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/openHAB-Binding#configure-items-file)

My souliss.items file is published [here](https://github.com/ribico/gr-home-automation/blob/master/openhab/configurations/items/souliss.items)

### sitemaps configuration

Move to sitemaps folder:

`cd /opt/openhab/configurations/sitemaps`

Create a sitemap file:

`sudo nano souliss.sitemap`

Create your personal sitemap according to the [OpenHAB syntax](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Explanation-of-Sitemaps).

I have two sitemaps, the one I use is published [here](https://github.com/ribico/gr-home-automation/blob/master/openhab/configurations/sitemaps/souliss.sitemap), the one designed for my wife is [here](https://github.com/ribico/gr-home-automation/blob/master/openhab/configurations/sitemaps/WAF.sitemap).

### using custom icons

My sitemaps uses some custom icons.

These icons shall be copied in folder /opt/openhab/webapps/images

## Start OpenHAB manually

By default the "start.sh" script is not an executable file. Do the following in order to make it executable:

`sudo chmod +x start.sh`

`sudo ./start.sh`

And the fun begins! You should have a fully loaded system with your items and sitemps according to your configuration.
Open you favorite browser and type (of course subsitute my ip address with the one of your server):

http://192.168.1.3:8080/openhab.app?sitemap=souliss

## Configuring openHAB to Start Automatically at Boot

Follow [this guide](http://www.homeautomationforgeeks.com/openhab_start.shtml).

In my first installation I encounter issues due to a wrong line end: the script was not working, a simple `dos2unix` command on the script solved the issue.

# Installing HABmin
[HABmin](https://github.com/cdjackson/HABmin#overview) is a web administration console for openHAB. It aims to provide a complete interface to administer openHAB.

Get the zip web address from the [habmin download page](https://github.com/cdjackson/HABmin/releases/latest).

Move to openhab folder:

`cd /opt/openhab`

Download the zip:

`wget https://github.com/cdjackson/HABmin/releases/download/0.1.3-snapshot/habmin.zip`

Unzip the package:

`unzip habmin.zip`

Remove the package:

`rm habmin.zip`

Restart openhab:

`sudo /etc/init.d/openhab restart`

Open habmin by simply pointing your browser to:

http://192.168.1.3:8080/habmin/index.html

# Enabling OpenHAB persistence

Check that package *org.openhab.persistence.rrd4j-1.7.1.jar* is present in folder openhab/addons

## Create a persistence rule

Move to persistence folder:

`cd /opt/openhab/configurations/persistence`

Create a new persistence rule:

`sudo nano rrd4j.persist'

And create your own rule according to [openhab syntax](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Persistence).

My persist file is published [here](https://github.com/ribico/gr-home-automation/blob/master/openhab/configurations/persistence/rrd4j.persist)

Restart openhab:

`sudo /etc/init.d/openhab restart`

To check that persistence is working you can look in /opt/openhab/etc/rrd4j/ for fresh rrd files.

If persistence and habmin are working on your system you may play a bit with very nice graphs:

# General Tips
Some general tips about Java perfomace on Raspberry Pi.

## rpi-update

Stay up to date with [rpi-update](https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update/)
An easier way to update the firmware of your Raspberry Pi.

## System memory

Java loves memory.
I'd rather suggest you to operate this unit headless and reduce GPU memory.

Run sudo raspi-config select memory_split and decrease GPU memory to 16. You'll get more than 100 Mb of additional system memory.

Disabling TV Service

For headless, add these to /etc/rc.local:

{% highlight c %}
## Limit GPU IRQs
fbset -xres 16 -yres 16 -vyres 16 -depth 8
/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -o
{% endhighlight %}

## Swap file

Do not swap! Manage your JVM memory consumption with -ms and -mx keys. If you absolutely have to swap move swap file (/var/swap) to USB HDD of fast flash drive because swapping to SD card is painfully slow. You can set swap size in /etc/dphys-swapfile config file.

## Overclocking

Overclocking does not seem to have a significant impact on OpenHAB performances.
