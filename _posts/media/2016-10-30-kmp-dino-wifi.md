The KMP DINo WiFi is finally here and has full support starting from [Souliss v7.2.1](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/releases/tag/v7.2-friariello.1) here we describe how get started with this board.

> Generally the DINo WiFi can be used as any other ESP8266 based board, but there are some tips that you should not to get started quickly!

This board is a natural evolution of previous KMP DINo boards that has been largely used with Souliss, we worked closely with KMP while defining the requirements of this board and as result there are Grove and UEXT connector to easily expand the functionality of the board with external sensor and peripherals without additional wiring.
As previous KMP DINo boards also the DINo WiFi has relays and opto-isolated inputs, is smaller than previous boards and share a similar **switching** regulated *on-board* power supply that goes from 5VDC to 30VDC.

The board comes boxed into a 3 modules DIN rail enclosure.

**Loading Souliss on DINo WiFi**

The first code upload need an USB to USART converter, next upload can use OTA. The board is not powered from the USART adapter so you need to connect and external power supply every time. The image below show the connection of the power supply wires and the correct position of the USART adapter provided (optionally) with the board.

> The pin mapping is the classic one that can be found on many USB to USART adapter, the GND is on the right side of the header and a 3.3VDC adapter shall be used

Near the header used to connect the USB to USART converter there is a jumper and a pushbutton (visible in the below picture), jumping it will allow to program the board. As alternative, power-off the board and press the *FLASH* button, with the button pressed power-on and then start uploading the code.

**Setup the Arduino IDE**

Just program this board as any other ESP8266 using the following settings:

- Flash Mode: QIO
- Flash Frequency : 40 MHz
- CPU Frequency : 80 MHz
- Flash Size : 4M (1M SPIFFS)
- Reset Methods : nodemcu
- Upload Speed : 115200

The use of the **portable** mode in the IDE (just create a folder called *portable*) is suggested, so that all libraries and cores will be locally installed with in the IDE folder.

You can use the DINo WiFi with Souliss v7.2.1 (or greater) mixing WiFi and RS485 networks, a couple of examples are bundled to build a chain of boards connected via RS485 with a WiFi bridge.

**The code below is for the Gateway**

This code will connect via WiFi to SoulissApp and via RS485 to the Peers
